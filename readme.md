To work with the Papagayo-NG source code, you need some special software installed. This software is not necessary to run the installer-based version of Papagayo-NG, but you do need it if you want to use this source code package.

## Requirements:

* sounddevice>=0.3.13
* cffi>=1.12.2
* numpy>=1.16.2
* pydub>=0.23.1
* anytree>=2.6.0
* PySide6

You can use the included requirements.txt with pip to install these, like this for example:  
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Running
To run Papagayo-NG, double-click the papagayo-ng.py file, or run the following command:  
``python3 papagayo-ng.py``

## Building
For Windows at least we use Nuitka via installer-creator which you can get via pip: ``pip install installer-creator``

You can build the executable and installer by running:

``py -m installer_creator build-exe -c build_config.yaml``

``py -m installer_creator build-installer -c build_config.yaml``

## Contents
The Papagayo-NG source package includes the following files:

- readme.md - this file
- gpl.txt - the user license for Papagayo-NG
- papagayo-ng.py - the main program file
- phonemes/*.json - phoneme sets in a JSON format
- LipsyncDoc.py - the document structure, including voices, phoneme breakdown, etc.
- breakdowns/*.py - code to break down words using language specific pronunciations
- LipsyncFrameQT.py - the main Papagayo-NG window
- WaveformViewRewrite.py - the waveform view in the main window
- MouthViewQT.py - the mouth view in the main window
- PronunciationDialogQT.py - a dialog to provide manual phoneme breakdown
- AboutBoxQT.py - about box
- rsrc/papagayo-ng2.ui - the QT Design File for the UI
- rsrc/ - various resources for Papagayo-NG, including button pictures, mouths, and language configuration/data
- rsrc/mouths/ - a folder containing the mouth pictures
- rsrc/languages/ - a folder containing the configuration and data for different languages
- papagayo-ng.ico - Windows icons
- papagayo-ng.icns - MacOS X icons
- setup.py - a script to build Papagayo-NG as a standalone Windows application
- setup_mac.py - a script to build Papagayo-NG as a standalone MacOS X application
- test/rsrc/ - Resource files used for testing language breakdown scripts in `breakdowns/`. Some breakdown scripts can be run directly (ex. `python -m breakdowns.korean_breakdown`) as a series of tests.

## Tips
Here are a couple tips for source code that you may want to modify:

By default, Papagayo-NG uses the Preston Blair phoneme set. There is also Fleming & Dobbs phoneme set available. The phoneme sets are stored in the phonemes sub folder. If you want to add a different set of phonemes, you can use existing sets as examples.

To add breakdowns for other languages create a new language configuration in `rsrc/languages/<language>` inside you need to place a configuration file (see italian for an example of how to configure a breakdown)  You will also need to create a breakdown class.  These live in breakdowns.  The naming convention is `<language>_breakdown.py`. Just examine one of the existing ones for how to make it work.  Make sure the function to call your breakdown processing is called **`breakdown_word`**.

Papagayo-NG now only works with Moho, but support could be added for other animation software, 2D or 3D. To add support for other export formats, look in the `LipsyncDoc.py` file for the function `LipsyncVoice:Export` - this is where Papagayo-NG exports switch data for Moho. You will also need to modify the file `LipsyncFrame.py` to add a user interface for exporting the new format.
